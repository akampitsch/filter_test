### Execution

You can either execute .feature or the RunSimpleDnsLookup_Test.java (this gives us the capability to generate Reports automatically and also for multithreading scenarios)

### Reports
reports will be found in your target folder if you use the TestNG file (feature files currently do not do this, but it's possible)
for cluecumber reports you will need to execute the maven goal, i have not found a way to make this automatic upon finishing a feature
