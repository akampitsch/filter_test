### Execution

You can either execute .feature or the RunsimpleDnsLookup_Test.java (this gives us the capability to generate Reports automatically and also for multithreading scenarios)

### Reports
reports will be found in your target folder
for cluecumber reports you will need to execute the maven goal, i have not found a way to make this automatic upon finishing a feature
